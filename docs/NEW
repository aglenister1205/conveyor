- scalar type for id is set to int, set it to ID
- bug in react-hook-form causing it to disrupt slots if used within same component:
  useForm(values) and SlotsProvider

- Assumptions:
-- every model has index, detail, creat pages for admin

components with useQuery will render 3x most likely: initial, dataFetched, processData
